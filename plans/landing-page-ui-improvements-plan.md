# Landing Page UI Improvements Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines comprehensive improvements to the VibeSpec landing page based on user feedback. The changes focus on better layout structures, cleaner design, official logos, and improved user experience.

## Requested Changes

### 1. Hero Section - Terminal Animation Extraction
**Current State:**
- Terminal animation is embedded directly in hero section (lines 74-110)
- Takes up significant space in the hero area

**Proposed Changes:**
- Extract terminal animation to a separate reusable component
- Create new file: `src/components/ui/terminal-animation.tsx`
- Make it configurable with props for:
  - Steps/commands to display
  - Animation timing
  - Color scheme
  - Size variants

**Benefits:**
- Reusable component for other pages
- Cleaner hero section
- Preserved design for future use

### 2. Specs Workflow Section - Side-by-Side Layout
**Current State:**
- Tab-based interface showing one workflow at a time
- Users must click to switch between "Start with Example" and "Start with Spec"

**Proposed Changes:**
- Remove tab interface
- Display both workflows side-by-side in vertical format
- Use responsive grid:
  - Desktop: 2 columns side-by-side
  - Mobile: Stacked vertically
- Keep animated workflow steps for both paths
- Add visual separator or clear labeling

**Benefits:**
- Users can compare both entry points immediately
- Better understanding of the two approaches
- Reduced interaction needed to see all options

### 3. Context Section - Official Logo Updates
**Current State:**
- Inline SVG logos created manually
- Inconsistent styling across logos
- Firebase logo included but no official file provided

**Proposed Changes:**
- Replace all inline SVGs with official logos from `/public/logos/`:
  - `nextdotjs.svg` → Next.js
  - `react.svg` → React
  - `typescript.svg` → TypeScript
  - `tailwindcss.svg` → Tailwind CSS
  - `shadcnui.svg` → shadcn/ui
  - `claude.svg` → Claude Code
- Use Next.js Image component for optimization
- Remove Firebase logo (no official file provided)
- Ensure consistent sizing and spacing
- Maintain hover effects

**Benefits:**
- Official, accurate logo representations
- Better performance with Next.js Image
- Consistent visual quality

### 4. Claude Section - Side-by-Side Display
**Current State:**
- Tab interface to switch between CLAUDE.md content and commands
- Only one view visible at a time

**Proposed Changes:**
- Remove tab interface
- Create two-column layout:
  - Left: CLAUDE.md content in code editor style
  - Right: Custom commands list
- Responsive behavior:
  - Desktop: Side-by-side
  - Tablet/Mobile: Stacked
- Maintain existing styling for both sections

**Benefits:**
- Full picture of Claude integration visible at once
- Reduced cognitive load
- Better showcase of capabilities

### 5. Workflow Section - Animation Redesign

**Proposed Changes:**

- Keep only primary actions:
  - GitHub button
  - Documentation button
- Simplify spacing and layout
- Remove "Open Source Note" section

**Benefits:**
