# Documentation Restructuring Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the comprehensive restructuring of VibeSpec's documentation to better separate template-specific rules from project-specific content. The goal is to enable users to adapt the template to their own projects while maintaining clear references to core guidelines.

## Objectives

1. **Relocate template-specific documents** into a dedicated `/vibespec/` folder
2. **Preserve all content** from the existing CLAUDE.md file in organized sub-documents
3. **Create template versions** of CLAUDE.md and README.md for user projects
4. **Implement /adapt command** to help users customize documentation for their specific projects
5. **Maintain clear references** between project docs and template guidelines

## Phase 1: Organize Template Documentation in /vibespec/

### 1.1 Create Core Template Documents

We'll split the current CLAUDE.md content into logical, focused documents:

#### **vibespec/project-structure.md**
Content to include:
- File Structure Organization (lines 32-50 from CLAUDE.md)
- Naming Conventions (lines 52-56)
- Directory explanations and rules
- Import path conventions

#### **vibespec/tech-stack.md**
Content to include:
- Important Technical Details section (lines 58-75)
- Tailwind CSS v4 configuration
- React 19 notes
- TypeScript configuration
- Package management guidelines

#### **vibespec/ai-assistant-rules.md**
Content to include:
- All 12 Strict Rules for AI Assistants (lines 198-291)
- Communication guidelines
- Code quality requirements
- Development discipline

#### **vibespec/naming-conventions.md**
Content to include:
- File naming rules (kebab-case)
- Directory naming rules
- Component export conventions
- Import patterns

#### **vibespec/development-workflow.md**
Content to include:
- Common Tasks section (lines 76-93)
- Environment Setup (lines 94-107)
- Development Workflow (lines 138-154)
- Testing Approach (lines 108-119)

#### **vibespec/architecture-principles.md**
Content to include:
- Key Architectural Decisions (lines 11-31)
- Architecture Principles (lines 166-188)
- Future Considerations (lines 189-197)
- Technical Context (lines 310-320)

#### **vibespec/code-quality.md**
Content to include:
- Code Quality Checklist (lines 155-165)
- Common Issues & Solutions (lines 120-137)
- Build and lint requirements
- TypeScript strictness rules

#### **vibespec/feature-flags.md**
Content to include:
- Feature Flags for Firebase Services (lines 13-24)
- Mock Services Pattern (lines 25-31)
- Progressive enhancement approach

#### **vibespec/claude-commands.md**
Content to include:
- Claude Commands section (lines 293-309)
- Workflow integration
- Command documentation references

### 1.2 Update Existing Files in /vibespec/

The following files already exist and should remain:
- `ai-development-guide.md`
- `ai-workflow-guide.md`
- `commands.md`
- `getting-started.md`
- `quick-start.md`
- `specifications.md`
- `troubleshooting.md`
- `workflow-quickstart.md`

We'll add cross-references between these and the new documents where appropriate.

## Phase 2: Create Template Versions

### 2.1 CLAUDE.md Template

Location: `vibespec/templates/CLAUDE.md.template`

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Technical Context

**MANDATORY: This document contains project-specific rules and technical context for AI assistants. All rules must be followed without exception.**

> **Document Precedence**: User instructions > CLAUDE.md > VibeSpec Template Documentation

## VibeSpec Template Guidelines

## Phase 3: Create /adapt Command

### 3.1 Command Implementation

Location: `.claude/commands/adapt.md`

```markdown
Help users adapt CLAUDE.md and README.md to their specific project after initial planning and specification phases.

## Usage
`/adapt`

## Overview

The adapt command helps transition from VibeSpec template documentation to project-specific documentation. It should be run after:
1. Creating initial specifications (`/transpose` or `/breakdown`)
2. Implementing core features
3. Establishing project identity

## Process

### Phase 1: Project Analysis

1. **Scan existing specifications**
   - Read all files in `/specs/`
   - Extract feature names and descriptions
   - Identify data models and API structures

2. **Review implementation status**
   - Check `/plans/` for completed work
   - Analyze current `/src/` structure
   - Identify implemented vs planned features

3. **Examine current documentation**
   - Check if CLAUDE.md has been modified
   - Review README.md current state
   - Note any project-specific additions

### Phase 2: Interactive Information Gathering

Ask the user for the following information:

1. **Basic Project Information**
   - Project name
   - Brief tagline (one sentence)
   - Full description (2-3 sentences)
   - Target audience
   - Primary value proposition

2. **Technical Details**
   - Additional dependencies beyond template
   - External services/APIs used
   - Deployment platform preference
   - Any specific environment variables

3. **Features and Status**
   - Confirm discovered features from specs
   - Mark which are complete/in-progress/planned
   - Add any missing features
   - Priority order for planned features

4. **Project-Specific Rules**
   - Business logic constraints
   - UI/UX guidelines specific to this project
   - Authentication/authorization rules
   - Data validation requirements

5. **Additional Context**
   - Known issues or limitations
   - Performance considerations
   - Security requirements
   - Any other important context

### Phase 3: Generate Adapted Documentation

1. **Create new CLAUDE.md**
   - Use `vibespec/templates/CLAUDE.md.template`
   - Fill in all placeholders with gathered information
   - Preserve all VibeSpec template references
   - Add discovered specifications and types
   - Include project-specific rules and context

2. **Create new README.md**
   - Use `vibespec/templates/README.md.template`
   - Professional project description
   - Complete feature list with status indicators
   - Proper badges and links
   - Clear getting started instructions
   - Deployment instructions if known

3. **Generate supplementary docs if needed**
   - `CONTRIBUTING.md` if requested
   - `API.md` if complex API structure
   - `DEPLOYMENT.md` if complex deployment

### Phase 4: Review and Finalize

1. **Present proposed changes**
   - Show diff of current vs new CLAUDE.md
   - Show diff of current vs new README.md
   - Highlight any sections needing review

2. **Allow modifications**
   - Let user edit any section
   - Suggest improvements if needed
   - Ensure accuracy of all information

3. **Apply changes**
   - Back up existing files to `.backup/`
   - Write new files
   - Update any references in other docs

4. **Post-adaptation tasks**
   - Remind to review and commit changes
   - Suggest running build/lint to verify
   - Note any TODOs added to documents

## Interactive Prompts

For each feature, please indicate status:
‚úÖ Complete
üöß In Progress  
üìã Planned
‚ùå Not implementing

[interactive status selection]

Any features I missed?: [user input]
```

## Error Handling

- If no specs found: Ask user to create specs first
- If template files missing: Reconstruct from this documentation
- If user unsure about answers: Provide sensible defaults
- If conflicts detected: Always ask for clarification

## Success Criteria

The adaptation is successful when:
1. Both CLAUDE.md and README.md reflect the actual project
2. All template references remain intact
3. Project-specific information is complete
4. Documentation is professional and clear
5. No template boilerplate remains unfilled

## Notes

- This command should be run once project identity is established
- Can be re-run to update documentation as project evolves
- Always preserves connection to VibeSpec template docs
- Encourages best practices in documentation
```

## Phase 4: Implementation Sequence

### Step 1: Create /vibespec/ directory structure
1. Create `/vibespec/` folder
2. Create `/vibespec/templates/` subfolder
3. Move existing template docs from root to `/vibespec/`

### Step 2: Split CLAUDE.md content
1. Create each new document in `/vibespec/`
2. Copy relevant sections from CLAUDE.md
3. Ensure no content is lost
4. Add cross-references between documents
5. Create an index or navigation document

### Step 3: Create template files
1. Create `CLAUDE.md.template` with placeholders
2. Create `README.md.template` with placeholders
3. Test placeholder replacement logic
4. Ensure all sections are covered

### Step 4: Implement /adapt command
1. Create command file in `.claude/commands/`
2. Implement analysis logic
3. Create interactive prompts
4. Test with sample project

### Step 5: Update existing documentation
1. Update current CLAUDE.md to reference `/vibespec/` docs
2. Add note about using `/adapt` command
3. Update root README.md if needed
4. Create migration guide for existing users

## Phase 5: Validation Checklist
