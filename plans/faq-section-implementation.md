# FAQ Section Implementation Plan

## Overview
Add a comprehensive FAQ section to the VibeSpec landing page to address common questions and improve user understanding of the product.

## Technical Decisions

### Component Architecture
- **Location**: `src/components/landing/faq-section.tsx`
- **Dependencies**: Reuse existing `Accordion` component from `src/components/ui/accordion.tsx`
- **Integration**: Place between `WorkflowSection` and `CTASection` in the landing page

### Design Approach
- Follow existing landing page design patterns
- Use consistent spacing, typography, and animations
- Implement smooth reveal animations matching other sections
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Component Creation
1. Create `faq-section.tsx` component
2. Import and configure Accordion component
3. Structure FAQ data with categories

### Phase 2: Content Organization
1. **General Questions**
   - What is VibeSpec?
   - Who is it for?
   - How does it differ from other templates?

2. **Technical Questions**
   - What's included in the template?
   - Can I use it without Firebase?
   - How do feature flags work?

3. **Workflow Questions**
   - How do I get started?
   - What are Claude commands?
   - How do sub-agents help development?

### Phase 3: Styling and Animation
1. Apply section container styles
2. Implement reveal animations
3. Ensure consistent spacing and typography
4. Test responsive behavior

### Phase 4: Integration
1. Import component in landing page
2. Position between WorkflowSection and CTASection
3. Verify smooth scroll behavior
4. Test overall page flow
