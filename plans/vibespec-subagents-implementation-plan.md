# VibeSpec Sub-Agents Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of specialized sub-agents for the VibeSpec framework, designed to accelerate spec-driven development and enforce the framework's core principles without adding friction to the developer workflow.

## Project Analysis: Understanding VibeSpec's Core Challenge

### The Problem VibeSpec Solves

After extensive analysis of the VibeSpec documentation and architecture, I've identified the core problem it addresses:

**AI-assisted development fails when AI lacks clear direction, leading to:**
- Wasted time as AI builds the wrong thing repeatedly
- Token burn from endless back-and-forth corrections
- Context window exhaustion from unfocused conversations
- Feature creep that delays shipping
- Inconsistent code patterns that create technical debt

### VibeSpec's Solution Architecture

VibeSpec solves this through:

1. **Specification-Driven Development**: Specs become the single source of truth
2. **Mock-First Pattern**: Decouple development from external dependencies
3. **Strict Architectural Rules**: Enforce patterns that AI can follow consistently
4. **Session-Based Workflow**: Track progress systematically to prevent context loss
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity only when needed

### Key Philosophical Principles

The framework embodies several crucial principles:
- **"Done is better than perfect"**: Ship MVPs, iterate based on real feedback
- **"Working code beats elegant architecture"**: Pragmatism over purism
- **"Real users beat imaginary ones"**: Get to market quickly
- **No testing for MVPs**: Manual testing suffices until you have paying customers
- **Save authentication for last**: Build features first, add auth when everything works

## Why Sub-Agents Are a Perfect Fit

Sub-agents align perfectly with VibeSpec's goals because they can:

1. **Automate Pattern Enforcement**: Instead of manually checking rules, agents ensure compliance automatically
2. **Prevent Specification Drift**: The #1 cause of wasted time in AI development
3. **Accelerate Repetitive Tasks**: Like creating mock services that follow the same pattern
4. **Maintain Development Velocity**: Prevent the natural tendency toward over-engineering
5. **Preserve Context Efficiently**: Each agent operates in its own context window

Most importantly, these agents act as **accelerators, not gatekeepers**. They make the right way the easy way.

## Detailed Sub-Agent Specifications

### 1. spec-guardian (Priority: Critical)

**Purpose**: Ensure implementation never drifts from specifications

**Problem It Solves**: 
- AI often "improves" on specs without being asked
- Developers lose track of original requirements
- Features grow beyond MVP scope

**Invocation Pattern**:
- Automatically after `/transpose` or `/breakdown` commands
- During implementation when detecting significant deviations
- On `/session:update` to verify alignment

**Key Behaviors**:
```markdown
1. Load current specification from specs/
2. Analyze recent code changes
3. Identify deviations:
   - Added features not in spec
   - Missing required features
   - Different UI/UX than specified
4. Report findings with severity levels:
   - üö® Critical: Core functionality differs
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Minor additions detected
   - üí° Note: Potential improvements (save for v2)
```

**Value Proposition**: Saves hours of rework by catching drift early

### 2. momentum-keeper (Priority: Critical)

**Purpose**: Prevent feature creep and maintain shipping velocity

**Problem It Solves**:
- Natural tendency to "perfect" instead of ship
- AI suggestions for "improvements" that delay launch
- Refactoring working code unnecessarily

**Invocation Pattern**:
- When detecting multiple rounds of improvements
- After refactoring suggestions
- When implementation exceeds estimated time

**Key Behaviors**:
```markdown
1. Monitor conversation for perfectionism signals:
   - "Let's also add..."
   - "We could improve this by..."
   - "A better approach would be..."
2. Check against original timeline/scope
3. Intervene with reminders:
   - Current MVP scope
   - Time already invested
   - "Ship now, improve later" principle
4. Suggest creating v2 specs instead
```

**Value Proposition**: Keeps projects on track for rapid delivery

### 3. rule-enforcer (Enhancement to existing code-reviewer)

**Purpose**: Enforce the 12 strict rules without slowing development

**Problem It Solves**:
- Manual rule checking is tedious
- Violations cause rework later
- Inconsistent application of standards

**Invocation Pattern**:
- After any code changes
- Before commits
- On explicit request

**Key Behaviors**:
```markdown
1. Run automated checks:
   - File naming (kebab-case only)
   - No test files created
   - No new mock data (except proper services)
   - Import paths use @/
   - No console.log statements
2. Verify build/lint pass:
   - npm run build
   - npm run lint
3. Check architectural compliance:
   - Components in correct directories
   - Services include mocks if needed
   - Providers properly organized
4. Report only actionable issues
```

**Value Proposition**: Prevents technical debt while maintaining velocity

### 4. [REMOVED] mock-first-builder

**Reason for Removal**: Building with mock services can lead to complications and problematic code. VibeSpec already includes a well-designed mock service pattern in the template - creating additional mock generators could encourage over-mocking and drift from real implementations.

### 4. session-shepherd (Priority: High)

**Purpose**: Enhanced session tracking with git integration

**Problem It Solves**:
- Context window exhaustion loses progress
- Difficult to resume after breaks
- Poor handoff between sessions

**Invocation Pattern**:
- Enhanced /session:update
- Before context window limit
- On session end

**Key Behaviors**:
```markdown
1. Capture comprehensive state:
   - Git diff since session start
   - Completed todos
   - Current specification
   - Key decisions made
2. Generate session summary:
   - What was accomplished
   - What remains
   - Any blockers
3. Prepare handoff document:
   - Next steps
   - Current context
   - Open questions
```

**Value Proposition**: Seamless continuation across sessions

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Velocity (Week 1)
1. **Enhance code-reviewer** ‚Üí rule-enforcer
2. **Create spec-guardian**
3. **Create momentum-keeper**

These three agents address the most critical pain points and can immediately improve development velocity.

### Phase 2: Workflow Enhancement
1. **Create session-shepherd**

These agents automate repetitive tasks and improve workflow continuity.

## Integration Architecture

### With Claude Commands
```yaml
/transpose:
  - Triggers: spec-guardian (validates generated spec)
  
/breakdown:
  - Triggers: spec-guardian (validates plan against spec)
  
/session:update:
  - Triggers: session-shepherd (captures progress)
  - Triggers: spec-guardian (checks alignment)
  
Code modifications:
  - Triggers: rule-enforcer (validates changes)
  
New service creation:
  - Manual implementation following VibeSpec patterns
```

### With Development Workflow
```yaml
Planning Mode:
  - spec-guardian: Validates specifications
  - momentum-keeper: Sets scope boundaries

Implementation:
  - rule-enforcer: Continuous validation
  - momentum-keeper: Prevents scope creep

Progress Tracking:
  - session-shepherd: Comprehensive state capture
  - spec-guardian: Alignment verification
```

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- **Specification Drift**: <5% of features deviate from spec
- **Build Failures**: <10% due to rule violations
- **Mock Creation Time**: 90% faster with automation
- **Session Continuity**: 100% successful handoffs

### Qualitative
- Developers feel agents accelerate, not hinder
- Reduced frustration from AI building wrong things
- Increased confidence in shipping quickly
- Better maintenance of project momentum

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **Over-enforcement**: Agents become annoying
   - Mitigation: Focus on actionable feedback only
   
2. **Context Confusion**: Too many agents active
   - Mitigation: Clear invocation patterns
   
3. **Performance Impact**: Agents slow development
   - Mitigation: Optimize for speed, async where possible

## Implementation Guidelines

### Agent Development Principles
1. **Be Helpful, Not Preachy**: Provide solutions, not lectures
2. **Be Fast**: Don't slow down the development flow
3. **Be Specific**: Actionable feedback only
4. **Be Contextual**: Understand the current development phase
5. **Be Aligned**: Follow VibeSpec's philosophy strictly

### Technical Considerations
- Agents use minimal tools for speed
- Each agent has a single, clear responsibility
- Agents enhance existing commands, not replace them
- All agents follow VibeSpec's own patterns

## Conclusion

These sub-agents represent a natural evolution of VibeSpec's methodology. By automating the enforcement of its principles and accelerating repetitive tasks, they allow developers to focus on what matters: shipping features that solve real problems for real users.

The key insight is that these agents don't add process‚Äîthey remove friction from the existing process. They make the VibeSpec way the easy way, which is exactly what good tooling should do.

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine this plan based on feedback
2. Begin Phase 1 implementation with rule-enforcer enhancement
3. Measure impact and adjust before Phase 2
4. Document learnings for the VibeSpec community

Remember: These agents exist to help developers ship faster, not to create perfect code. They embody the same pragmatic philosophy that makes VibeSpec effective: done is better than perfect, working code beats elegant architecture, and real users beat imaginary ones.
