- Focus: Time and token savings, ROI for founders
- Tone: Direct, metrics-focused, results-oriented

**Option B: "The Workflow Revolution"**
- Tagline: "From idea to spec to MVP, without the headaches"
- Focus: Transforming how founders build with AI
- Tone: Transformative, visionary, empowering

**Option C: "The Practical Builder"**
- Tagline: "Spec-driven development that actually works"
- Focus: No-nonsense approach to AI coding
- Tone: Pragmatic, honest, experienced

### 1.2 Hero Section Variations

**Version 1: Founder-Focused**

- "Scale when you're ready"

## Phase 4: Implementation Process

### 4.1 Round 1: Copy Creation
1. Generate 3 complete sets of landing page copy
2. Create 3 README versions
3. Draft multiple tagline options
4. Write various feature descriptions

### 4.2 Round 2: Review & Refine
1. Present options for feedback
2. Mix and match best elements
3. Refine based on preferences
4. Create hybrid versions

### 4.3 Round 3: Polish & Finalize
1. Fine-tune selected copy
2. Ensure consistency across all docs
3. Add personality touches
4. Final review and adjustments

## Phase 5: Documentation Strategy

### 5.1 Core Documents (Multiple Versions)
- **README.md**: 3 length options
- **QUICKSTART.md**: Step-by-step guide
- **WHY-VIBESPEC.md**: Detailed explanation

### 5.2 Supporting Materials
- Example workflows with real commands
- Success stories/case studies
- Comparison with traditional approaches
- FAQ addressing common concerns

## Phase 6: Visual Language Options

### 6.1 Terminal Animations
**Option A**: Show real-time coding session
**Option B**: Before/after comparison
**Option C**: Step-by-step workflow

### 6.2 Workflow Diagrams
**Option A**: Flowchart style
**Option B**: Timeline style
**Option C**: Comparison table

## Success Criteria
- At least 3 distinct copy versions to choose from
- Each version tested for clarity and appeal
- Final copy resonates with founder audience
- Messaging consistent across all touchpoints

## Next Steps
1. Create initial copy variations (3 sets)
2. Review and gather feedback
3. Iterate based on preferences
4. Mix best elements from each version
5. Polish final selection
6. Apply across all documentation

## Notes
- User emphasizes need for multiple iterations
- Avoid mentioning mock services
- Focus on spec-driven workflows
- Highlight Claude Code integration
- Target audience: founders building MVPs
- Make workflows more concrete and less abstract

This iterative approach ensures we find the perfect voice for VibeSpec while maintaining flexibility throughout the creative process.
