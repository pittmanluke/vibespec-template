# Specifications Directory

This directory contains feature specifications and product requirements documents (PRDs).

## What belongs here?

- **Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)**: Overall product vision and requirements
- **Feature Specifications**: Detailed requirements for individual features
- **User Stories**: User-focused descriptions of functionality
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear definitions of "done"
- **Technical Specifications**: Detailed technical requirements
- **API Specifications**: Endpoint definitions and contracts

## What doesn't belong here?

- Implementation details (use `/plans` instead)
- Code examples (use `/examples` instead)
- General documentation (use `/docs` instead)
- Work-in-progress notes

## Directory Structure

Organize specs by feature or module:
```
specs/
├── README.md (this file)
├── product-requirements.md (master PRD)
├── features/
│   ├── user-authentication.md
│   ├── user-profile.md
│   └── payment-processing.md
└── api/
    ├── rest-api-spec.md
    └── graphql-schema.md
```

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive, feature-focused filenames:
- `user-authentication-spec.md`
- `payment-processing-spec.md`
- `admin-dashboard-spec.md`
- `api-v2-specification.md`

## Specification Template

2. Users MUST be able to...
3. The feature SHOULD...

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: [specific metrics]
- Security: [requirements]
- Accessibility: [standards to meet]

## User Interface
- Mockups or wireframes
- User flow descriptions
- Component specifications

## Data Model
- Entities involved
- Relationships
- Validation rules

## API Design
- Endpoints needed

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, testable criteria
- [ ] Another measurable outcome
- [ ] Clear success metrics

## Out of Scope
What this feature does NOT include.

## Dependencies
- Other features required
- External services needed
- Technical prerequisites

## Timeline
- Estimated complexity: [S/M/L/XL]

```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Ambiguity leads to rework
2. **Think User-First**: Focus on user value
3. **Define Success**: Clear acceptance criteria
4. **Set Boundaries**: Explicitly state what's out of scope
5. **Stay Current**: Update specs as requirements evolve
