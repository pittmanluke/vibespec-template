  - `agents/` - ✅ 24 agents present
  - `commands/` - ✅ All shortcuts created
  - `hooks/` - ✅ Infrastructure complete
  - `health/` - ✅ Monitoring system ready
  - `state/` - ✅ Persistence layer implemented
  - `workflow-state/` - ✅ Runtime data directory

### 2. Multi-Agent System ✅

  - compliance.md ✅
  - event-flow-designer.md ✅
  - hook-system-engineer.md ✅

### 3. Workflow Commands ✅
All workflow shortcuts are properly created:
- `/wr` (wr.md) - ✅ Parallel review
- `/wv` (wv.md) - ✅ Validation pipeline
- `/wi` (wi.md) - ✅ Guided implementation
- `/wh` (wh.md) - ✅ Workflow help
- `/wl` (wl.md) - ✅ Workflow list
- `/vibespec:health` (vibespec-health.md) - ✅ Health monitoring

**Note**: Both shortcut versions (e.g., `wr.md` and `workflow-review.md`) exist for flexibility.

### 4. Hook Infrastructure ✅
All hooks installed and enabled:
- **pre-commit** - ✅ Installed & Git integrated
- **post-tool-use** - ✅ Installed & Enabled
- **file-watcher** - ✅ Installed (Process stopped)

- Event routing table: ✅ Configured
- Event system manager: ✅ Available
- Total event files: 7 components found

### 6. Health Monitoring ✅
All visualization components present:
- dashboard-renderer.js ✅
- report-templates.js ✅
- visualization-components.js ✅
- dashboard-cli.js ✅
- Integration test suite ✅

### 7. State Management ✅
Complete persistence infrastructure:
- state-manager.ts ✅
- checkpoint-manager.ts ✅
- workflow-state-api.ts ✅
- session-manager.ts ✅
- hook-integration.ts ✅

## ⚠️ Minor Issues Found

### 1. File Watcher Process
- **Status**: Stopped
- **Impact**: No real-time file monitoring
- **Fix**: Start with `./.claude/hooks/file-watcher.py --daemon &`

### 2. Event System Process
- **Status**: Unknown (needs verification)
- **Impact**: Event routing may not be active
- **Fix**: Check with `./.claude/hooks/event-system-manager.sh status`

## 🚀 Quick Fixes

```bash
# 1. Start file watcher daemon
./.claude/hooks/file-watcher.py --daemon &

# 2. Start event system
./.claude/hooks/event-system-manager.sh start

# 3. Verify all systems
./.claude/hooks/hook-manager.sh status
```

## ✅ What's Working

1. **All 24 specialized agents** are created and available
2. **All workflow commands** are properly configured
3. **Hook infrastructure** is complete with Git integration

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Start background processes**:
   ```bash
   ./.claude/hooks/file-watcher.py --daemon &
   ./.claude/hooks/event-system-manager.sh start
   ```

2. **Test workflow commands**:
   - Try `/wr` for a code review
   - Run `/wv` for validation
   - Check `/vibespec:health`

3. **Monitor system**:
   ```bash
   ./.claude/hooks/hook-manager.sh monitor
   ```
