## Workflow Visual Section

### Title
Two Clear Paths to Implementation

### Subtitle
Choose your starting point based on what you have. Both lead to well-structured, AI-built applications.

### Path 1: Design-First Development
**When you can visualize your idea**

Step 1: Create Your Vision
- Sketch in Figma, React, or any tool
- Focus on what you want to see
- Save to examples/ directory

Step 2: Generate Specification  
- Run `/transpose` on your design
- Automatically creates structured spec
- AI now understands your vision

Step 3: Build with Clarity
- AI follows the specification
- Consistent implementation
- No guessing or confusion

### Path 2: Requirements-First Development
**When you know what you need**

Step 1: Document Requirements
- Write user stories or features
- Plain English is perfect
- Save to specs/ directory

Step 2: Create Implementation Plan
- Run `/breakdown` on your spec
- Generates phased approach
- Clear milestones to follow

Step 3: Execute Systematically
- Follow the generated plan
- Build incrementally
- Each phase is complete and testable
