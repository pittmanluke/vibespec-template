# Product Roadmap Reference

## Overview

This document serves as the single source of truth for VibeSpec's product development roadmap. It provides detailed context for each upcoming feature, technical implementation notes, and guidance for development cycles.

**Purpose:**
- Central reference for product planning
- Context for AI assistants and contributors
- Documentation of feature requirements and dependencies
- Planning resource for future development cycles

**Roadmap Structure:**
The roadmap is now organized by priority rather than categories:
- **ðŸš€ In Progress** - Actively being developed
- **ðŸ“‹ Up Next** - High priority items queued for development
- **ðŸ’­ Future Ideas** - Everything else under consideration
- **âœ… Recently Shipped** - Completed in the last ~30 days

Features can be voted on by the community to help inform priorities.
