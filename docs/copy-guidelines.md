# VibeSpec Copy Guidelines

*Essential rules for maintaining authenticity and trust in all VibeSpec communications*

## Core Principles

### 1. No Unproven Claims

**Never make specific claims about:**
- Time savings (e.g., "70% faster")
- Cost reductions (e.g., "50% less tokens")
- Success rates (e.g., "90% first-time success")
- Timeline guarantees (e.g., "MVP in 14 days")

**Why:** As a new product, we don't have data to support these claims. Making unsubstantiated promises damages trust and sets unrealistic expectations.

**Instead:**
- Focus on the approach and methodology
- Describe features and benefits conceptually
- Let users draw their own conclusions
- Use phrases like "designed to" or "aims to"

### 2. No Fabricated Testimonials

**Never create:**
- Fake user testimonials
- Invented success stories
- Fictional case studies
- Made-up statistics about users

**Why:** Trust is our most valuable asset. Fake social proof is unethical and will backfire when discovered.

**Instead:**
- Share the problem we're solving
- Explain our approach
- Describe the vision
- Use our own experience as examples (when relevant)

## Acceptable Copy Approaches

### ✅ DO Use:

**Problem-Focused Language**
- "Frustrated with AI coding chaos?"
- "Specifications bring clarity to AI development"
- "A structured approach to building with AI"

**Feature Descriptions**
- "Built-in Claude Code commands"
- "Specification-driven workflow"
- "Session management included"

**Benefit Statements (Without Metrics)**
- "Designed to reduce confusion"
- "Aims to streamline AI development"
- "Structured to save time"

**Vision Statements**
- "We believe AI coding should be predictable"
- "Our goal is to make AI development accessible"
- "Building towards efficient AI workflows"

### ❌ DON'T Use:

**Specific Metrics**
- "Save 70% development time"
- "Cut costs by 50%"
- "10x faster than alternatives"

**Guarantees**
- "Launch in 2 weeks"
- "First customer in 30 days"
- "Guaranteed success"

**Fake Social Proof**
- "Join 3,000+ founders" (unless true)
- "Sarah from startup X says..."
- "$50M in founder revenue" (unless verified)

## Voice Guidelines

### Be Honest
- Acknowledge we're new
- Be transparent about our stage
- Share our journey and learnings

### Be Helpful
- Focus on solving real problems
- Provide value upfront
- Educate rather than sell

### Be Humble
- We're learning too
- Open to feedback
- Building with the community

## Example Transformations

**Before (Problematic):**
"VibeSpec reduces development time by 70% and cuts token costs in half. Join 3,000+ founders shipping MVPs in 14 days."

**After (Honest):**
"VibeSpec brings structure to AI development through specifications. We're building a better way to work with AI assistants."

**Before (Problematic):**
"'Best investment ever! Saved $10k in development costs.' - John, Founder"

**After (Honest):**
"We built VibeSpec from our own frustrations with AI coding. Now we're sharing it with founders facing the same challenges."

## Future Considerations

Once we have real users and data:
1. Collect genuine testimonials with permission
2. Track actual metrics to support claims
3. Build case studies from real implementations
4. Update copy with verified information

Until then, we build trust through:
- Transparency
- Quality
- Community
- Continuous improvement

## Remember

Every piece of copy represents our values. When in doubt, choose honesty over hype. Our users will appreciate the authenticity, and it will build a stronger foundation for long-term success.
