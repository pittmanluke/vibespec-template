### Title
A Workflow That Actually Flows

Two paths, both designed to get you from idea to implementation without the typical AI frustrations.

### Path 1: Start with Design
**Perfect when you can see it but can't describe it**

Step 1: Show, Don't Tell
- Drop in your mockup or example
- "This is what I want"
- No more struggling to describe UI in words

Step 2: Let VibeSpec Translate
- `/transpose` turns visuals into specifications
- AI finally understands your vision
- Clear requirements, not vague descriptions

Step 3: Build with Confidence
- AI follows the spec exactly
- No surprises, no "that's not what I meant"
- Your vision becomes reality

### Path 2: Start with Requirements
**Perfect when you know what you want to build**

Step 1: Write What You Know
- Document your features naturally
- User stories, requirements, or simple lists
- Your words, your way

Step 2: Get a Clear Plan
- `/breakdown` creates actionable phases
- Complex projects become manageable
- Know exactly what's next

Step 3: Execute Smoothly
- Follow the roadmap step by step
- Each phase builds on the last
- Ship incrementally with confidence

### Supporting Features
