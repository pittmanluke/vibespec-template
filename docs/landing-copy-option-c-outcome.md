## Problem/Solution Section

### Title
Why Most AI-Built MVPs Fail

### Subtitle
It's not the AI‚Äîit's the approach. Here's what successful founders do differently.

### Problems & Solutions

**Failure: Endless Iteration**
- ‚ùå 6 months tweaking, 0 customers
- ‚úÖ Our way: Ship in sprints, learn from users
- ‚Üí Launch v1 in 2 weeks, iterate with real feedback

**Failure: Perfect Code, No Product**
- ‚ùå Beautiful architecture, empty bank account
- ‚úÖ Our way: Good enough code that makes money
- ‚Üí Revenue before refactoring

**Failure: AI Confusion Paralysis**
- ‚ùå 1000 prompts, still not right
- ‚úÖ Our way: Specifications that work first time
- ‚Üí Build features, not prompts

**Failure: Solo Founder Burnout**
- ‚ùå Doing everything = doing nothing well
- ‚úÖ Our way: AI handles code, you handle customers
- ‚Üí Focus on what only you can do
