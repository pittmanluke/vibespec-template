## Problem/Solution Section

### Title
Common AI Coding Frustrations

### Subtitle
If you've tried building with AI, you've probably experienced these. Here's how we handle them.

### Problems & Our Approach

**Inconsistent Results**
- The frustration: Different output every time you ask
- Our approach: Specifications create consistency
- Why it helps: AI has clear instructions to follow

**Lost Context**

- Our approach: Session management tracks everything
- Why it helps: Resume right where you left off

**Messy Code Organization**
- The frustration: Files in random places
- Our approach: Strict project structure
- Why it helps: AI always knows where things go

**Vague Communication**
- The frustration: AI doesn't understand what you want
- Our approach: Specifications clarify intent
- Why it helps: Less back-and-forth, more building

## Workflow Visual Section

### Title
Two Ways to Build

### Subtitle
Whether you start with mockups or written requirements, VibeSpec helps you build systematically.

### Path 1: From Mockup to Product
**When you can see what you want**

Your Design
- Sketch your interface
- Use any tool you prefer
- Focus on the user experience

Create Specification
- Use `/transpose` command
- Converts visual to structured spec
- AI understands your intent

Build with Confidence
- AI follows the specification
- Consistent implementation
- Your vision realized

### Path 2: From Idea to Product
**When you know what you need**

Your Requirements
- Write what it should do
- List features and behaviors
- Use plain language

Generate Plan
- Use `/breakdown` command
- Creates phased approach
- Manageable chunks

Execute Step by Step
- Follow the plan
- Build incrementally
- See progress clearly

### What Both Paths Share

**âœ“ Clear Specifications**
No more guessing games with AI

**âœ“ Consistent Results**
Same input, same output

**âœ“ Trackable Progress**
Know where you are in the process
